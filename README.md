Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a consulting company that provides customized financial plans for its clients. They were looking to hire our company, Global Rain, to update their software's security standards.

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

Software security is vital to a company's well-being. Their reputation is staked on providing customers with safe, secure service, and data leaks can not only lose these customers, but can be very pricey if lawsuits or reimbursment is involved. This same principle applies to all coding; it is important to keep to good industry standards in order to ensure that there are no vulnerabilites or exploits that hackers can utilize.

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

I struggled a lot with finding false positives

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

I utiized an encryption algorithm and implemented input verification to increase security. The Maven dependency checks were a huge help in identifying vulnerabilities so that I could decide on what techniques would be best suited to fixing them.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

Manual review was my main tool to ensure that no errors were added in my code. The Eclipse IDE was also very helpful in catching errors. I then ran a dependency check in order to ensure that I had nod introduced any new vulnerabilities.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I will utilize the OWASP website in the future for its vast collection of vulnerabilities along with possible ways to fix them. I would show a potential employee the SHA-256 integration along with its hash generation from this assignment.
